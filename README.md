# Saved Messages Telegram Bot

I love Telegram. I often use the Saved Messages feature in Telegram.
I had a need to save all messages sent in Saved Messages to my computer's hard drive.
But I don't want to run the Telegram client on my computer every time.
Also, I'd like my wife and my friends to be able to save the files I need on my computer.

This is a .NET 7 console application. In the future, I want to add running the application as a Windows service, perhaps adding a UI for entering application configurations.

# Usage

Just add your token, username to globalSettings.json and compile!
